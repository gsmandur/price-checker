# price_checker

Python program that emails you when a product (that you NEED) changes prices. It also logs the price changes in a csv so you can track overtime. 

Ideally you want to pair this with a cronjob or taskmanager and run it daily.

To track a certain product, change the info in the main section at the bottom (in particular the 4 variables). Along with this add your the email information in the SendEmailAlert function. 

The product I tested it with is the Nike Flyknits:
